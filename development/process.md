<h1>General Development Ideas/Notes</h1>

<p>Points of Interest</p>

<h3>Switching to PixiJS</h3>
<p>PixiJS is POWERFUL and should be utilized in the backend.</p>

<h3>Firefox Nightly</h3>
<p>Development should focus on Firefox, specifically the nightly builds. Not only does Firefox have a better handle on GPU acceleration, but their nightly builds have been pretty consistent in having emergent web technologies as optional features. Chrome Canary is my second preference for a development environment.</p>
