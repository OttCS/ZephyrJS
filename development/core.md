<h1>Core Ideals of Zephyr</h1>

<h3>Zephyr should simplify</h3>
<p>Zephyr will limit the amount of information that is needed to develop and utilize commonly taught coding practices to allow for an easier learning curve than alternatives.</p>

<h3>Zephyr should evolve quickly</h3>
<p>Zephyr will be well documented and be easily adjustable to take advantage of emerging web technologies, and respond to changes in implemented technologies faster.</p>

<h3>Zephyr should not hinder</h3>
<p>Zephyr will not limit the actual functionality of any implemented technologies, only provide streamlined ways to use them.</p>

<h3>Zephyr should help</h3>
<p>Zephyr will have documentation available for advanced developers to expand upon Zephyr for personal use, or to contribute to the project.</p>
