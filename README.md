<h1>ZephyrJS</h1>

<p>An expansion on PixiJS to provide the tools you need to quickly develop games and interactive content.</p>

<h2>Tell Me Why</h2>

<p>PixiJS on its own is very powerful, but a lot of work is needed to make it work for web-based games. PhaserIO is exclusively used to make games, and not all of the functionality is easily translatable back to Pixi. ZephyrJS directly ADDS to Pixi instead of wrapping it, letting you use the full functionality of Pixi so that the work is translatable.</p>

<h2><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OttCS/ZephyrJS/main/dev/zepyhr.js">Download</a> & Get Started!</h2>

<p>Just by downloading the file including the following lines:</p>

<code>&lt;script src="https&#58;//pixijs.download/release/pixi.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
<br/>
<code>&lt;script src="../path/to/zephyr.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>

<p>all of the functionality of PixiJS and Zephyr have been added!</p>
